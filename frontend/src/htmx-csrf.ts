// Django's CSRF token on every htmx request. Imported for its side effect; no-op without htmx.
//
// htmx does not add Django's CSRF header by itself, and a POST without it is a 403. Registered
// globally on document.body rather than per element, so every hx-post on the site is covered —
// including ones added long after this was written.
//
// Extracted from feed.ts, where it originally lived at module scope beside Den Hurtige's poll
// logic. It was already global there, so this is a move rather than a behaviour change — but a
// second feature (opslagstavlen) now depends on it, and depending on a file named after the chat
// feature is a trap: trimming feed.ts to the chat page would silently break CSRF elsewhere.

  // Fallback for CSRF_USE_SESSIONS or a missing cookie: any rendered {% csrf_token %} input.
  return document.querySelector<HTMLInputElement>('input[name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"]')?.value ?? "";

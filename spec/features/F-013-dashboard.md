# Feature: Dashboard — internal-area landing page (nyintern forside)

- **Feature ID:** F-013
- **Source file(s):** `application/controllers/intern/dashboard.php`,
  `application/views/intern/dashboard.php`,
  base `application/core/MY_Controller.php` (`showInternPage()`),
  helper `application/helpers/gahk_helper.php` (`insideGAHK()`).
  (`application/models/internuser_model.php` is loaded in the constructor but **never used** by this feature — see Quirks.)
- **URL / route:** (route `nyintern → intern/dashboard`, default action `index`; the generic
  `nyintern/(:any) → intern/$1` route also resolves `nyintern/dashboard`)
  - `GET /nyintern/` — dashboard (index)
  - `GET /nyintern/dashboard/` — dashboard (index, via generic route)
- **HTTP method(s):** GET only (no form submitted from this page; `index()` ignores POST).
- **Access control:** **logged-in**, enforced **inline** in `index()`:
  `$this->session->userdata('username')` must be truthy, else the request is redirected to
  `nyintern/admin` (login). Uses the standard CI session userdata auth pattern (see `01-infrastructure.md` A4/A5).
  ⚠ No role checks — any logged-in user sees the page. A second, **non-auth** gate inside the
  view, `insideGAHK()` (campus-IP check, see `01-infrastructure.md` A9), governs the secret blocks.

**Routes / actions:**
| Action | URL | Method | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `index` | `/nyintern/` | GET | logged-in (`username`) | render the internal landing page; on-campus IP additionally sees WiFi + calendar credentials |
| `index` | `/nyintern/dashboard/` | GET | logged-in (`username`) | same (generic route alias) |

## Purpose
The forside ("front page") a resident lands on after logging into GAHK Intern. It is a static welcome
page: a link to change one's password, a contact mail for the network group, links to the alumne-list
and GAHK-Intern mobile apps, and an embedded Google calendar of house events. For users connecting from
the GAHK campus network it additionally reveals the shared Wi-Fi password and a shared Google-calendar
login so on-site residents can join the network and add events.

## Inputs
| Name | Source | Type | Required? | Validated/sanitized? | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `username` | session userdata | string | yes (auth gate) | n/a (read-only) | truthiness check in `index()` (`dashboard.php:17,19`); if falsy → redirect |
| `current_url()` | derived (CI URL helper) | string | n/a | n/a | stored as `redirectToUrlAfterLogin` flashdata before redirect (`dashboard.php:20`) |
| `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` | request (client IP) | string | implicit | compared to a hardcoded allow-list of 6 IPs | `insideGAHK()` (`gahk_helper.php:4-6`) — gates the two secret blocks in the view (`dashboard.php:47,78`) |
| `fullname`, `alumne_id`, `akRole`, `indstilling`, `inspektion`, `kokkengruppe`, `oelkaelder`, `administrator` | session userdata | mixed | no | n/a | read by `showInternPage()` (`MY_Controller.php:14-32`) and passed to header/footer views for menu/chrome — **not** used by the dashboard body itself |
| `pagename` = `"dashboard"`, `pageheader` = `"Forside"` | controller literals | string | n/a | n/a | view data set in `index()` (`dashboard.php:23-24`) |

There are **no** GET query params, POST fields, or route segments consumed by this feature.

## Database interactions
- **Tables touched:** **none** by this feature's own code path.
- **Reads:** none. (The controller loads `Internuser_model` in `__construct` but never calls it; the
  body reads only session userdata, which is CI's DB-session lookup handled by the session library, not
  by this feature.)
- **Writes:** **none.** ⚠ Unlike the public controllers (`admin`, `optagelse`, `news`, `page`, `pylon`),
  `intern/dashboard.php` does **not** call `$this->counter()` in its constructor. The visit counter
  (`gahk_counter`/`gahk_counterdato` via `MY_Controller::counter()`) therefore does **NOT** run on
  dashboard hits — contrary to the task's stated assumption. See Quirks.
- **Transactions / ordering:** none.

## Business logic
- `index()` reads `username` from the session.
  - If falsy: set flashdata `redirectToUrlAfterLogin = current_url()` and `redirect("nyintern/admin")`
    (login page). Nothing rendered.
  - Otherwise: set `pagename="dashboard"`, `pageheader="Forside"` and call
    `showInternPage('intern/dashboard', $data)`, which wraps `intern/header` + the dashboard body +
    `intern/footer` (with session-derived chrome variables).
- The view body is **mostly static HTML** with two conditional secret blocks, both gated by
  `insideGAHK()` (returns true only when `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` is one of 6 hardcoded campus IPs:
  `130.225.243.26`, `192.38.116.242`–`.246` — `gahk_helper.php:4`):
  - **Block 1 (`dashboard.php:47-55`):** prints the **plaintext Wi-Fi password**
    `IAlleDeRigerOgLande1908` plus links to the WiFi wiki page and the MAC-address page.
  - **Block 2 (`dashboard.php:78-87`):** prints a **shared Google-calendar login** in plaintext —
    E-mail `gahkkalender`, password (Adgangskode) `nokolugter` — plus a Google ServiceLogin link.
- Always shown (no gate): welcome header, "change your password" link
  (`http://gahk.dk/nyintern/admin/changepassword`), `mailto:it@gahk.dk`, alumne-list app links
  (web + Google Play), GAHK-Intern Google Play badge, and the Google-calendar **iframe**.
- **Branching:** the only branch is `insideGAHK()` (on/off, per request IP). No per-user/per-role
  branching in the body.

## Outputs & side effects
- **Renders:** the internal forside HTML inside the intern header/footer chrome (via `showInternPage()`).
- **Secret leakage (on-campus IPs only):**
  - Wi-Fi password `IAlleDeRigerOgLande1908` in cleartext (`dashboard.php:49`).
  - Google-calendar credentials `gahkkalender` / `nokolugter` in cleartext (`dashboard.php:83-84`).
  These are **hardcoded in the view source** regardless of IP; `insideGAHK()` only decides whether they
  are *echoed*. The secrets are present in the repository/source for anyone with file access.
- **Embeds:** a Google Calendar `<iframe>` to `google.com/calendar/embed` for calendars
  `gahkkalender@gmail.com` and `mnic13suhuvarq6ffitg2j30m4@group.calendar.google.com` (`dashboard.php:76`).
- **Redirect:** unauthenticated → `redirect("nyintern/admin")` with `redirectToUrlAfterLogin` flashdata.
- **Session/headers:** `session_start()` is called in the constructor (`dashboard.php:6`) in addition to
  CI's own session library — see Quirks. No custom headers, no cache directives (this controller does
  **not** set the no-cache headers that, e.g., `optagelse` does).
- **Visit-counter write:** **none** (see Database interactions — `counter()` is not invoked here).

## Dependencies
- **Cross-cutting infra used:** `MY_Controller` base + `showInternPage()` (intern header/footer chrome,
  session-derived view vars) — `01-infrastructure.md` A9; CI DB sessions / session userdata auth —
  `01-infrastructure.md` A4/A5; `insideGAHK()` campus-IP gate — `01-infrastructure.md` A9. Referenced by
  name; not re-described here.
- **Helpers/libraries loaded in constructor:** `form` helper, `gahk_helper` (for `insideGAHK()`),
  `session` library, `Internuser_model` model. ⚠ Of these, only `gahk_helper`/`session` are actually
  used; `form` helper and `Internuser_model` are loaded but unused on this page.
- **External:** Google Calendar embed (iframe) + Google account ServiceLogin link; Google Play / app
  store image badges; `gahk.dk` wiki & app pages. All are hardcoded URLs in the view.

## Security findings
| Issue | Location | Severity | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hardcoded plaintext Wi-Fi password in source/view | `views/intern/dashboard.php:49` | **High** | `IAlleDeRigerOgLande1908` committed in the template; in repo and served to on-campus clients |
| Hardcoded plaintext Google-calendar credentials in source/view | `views/intern/dashboard.php:83-84` | **High** | user `gahkkalender` / pass `nokolugter` committed in the template |
| Secret display gated only by client-IP allow-list | `helpers/gahk_helper.php:4-6`, `dashboard.php:47,78` | **Medium** | `insideGAHK()` trusts `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`; spoofable behind a misconfigured proxy / `X-Forwarded-For` rewrite, and bypassable by anyone with repo/source access regardless of IP |
| Auth check is inline, not centralized; no role enforcement | `dashboard.php:17-22` | **Low** | any logged-in `username` sees the page (acceptable for a landing page, but auth is duplicated per-controller) |
| No CSRF token / no output escaping concerns | view is static | **Low/Info** | no user input is reflected, so no reflected XSS here; CSRF N/A (no state change). `csrf_protection=false` site-wide (`01-infra` A4) but irrelevant for this GET-only page |
| Redundant `session_start()` alongside CI session lib | `dashboard.php:6` | **Low** | manual PHP `session_start()` plus CI `session` library; possible double session handling (inherited pattern across intern controllers) |

Record, do not fix.

## Quirks, edge cases & suspected bugs
- **Visit counter does NOT run here.** The task brief assumed `MY_Controller` runs the counter on every
  hit, but `MY_Controller::__construct()` (`MY_Controller.php:5-10`) does **not** call `counter()`;
  each controller calls `$this->counter()` itself, and `intern/dashboard.php` does **not**. So dashboard
  views are **not** counted. (Contrast `optagelse.php:23`, `admin.php:8`, `news.php:9`, `page.php:10`,
  `pylon.php:9`, which do.) ⚠ Surfaced as a finding, not corrected.
- **Secrets live in version-controlled template source.** Even off-campus, the Wi-Fi password and
  calendar credentials are readable by anyone who can see the repo or the raw PHP; `insideGAHK()` only
  controls runtime echo.
- **`insideGAHK()` ignores IPv6 and proxies.** Pure exact-match against 6 IPv4 literals; behind a reverse
  proxy `REMOTE_ADDR` may be the proxy's IP, so on-campus users could *lose* the blocks, or a spoofed
  forwarded address scenario could *gain* them — depends on deployment.
- **Unused loads:** `Internuser_model` and the `form` helper are loaded in the constructor but never used
  by the dashboard. The model is fully analyzed only because the brief named it; this feature touches none
  of its methods.
- **Hardcoded `http://` (non-TLS) links** to `gahk.dk/nyintern/admin/changepassword` and the wiki
  (`dashboard.php:41,50`) — mixed-content / downgrade risk if the site is HTTPS.
- The "Sep/Okt"-style month-array bug noted in F-001 is not present here (no date logic).
- `pagename`/`pageheader` are set but the body view does not reference them; they feed header/footer chrome.

## Reimplementation notes (Django)
- **View type:** a simple `TemplateView` (login-required via `LoginRequiredMixin`, redirecting
  unauthenticated users to the nyintern login). **Template:** a static `dashboard.html` extending the
  intern base layout; keep the calendar `<iframe>`.
- **FIX (record + confirm first):** move the Wi-Fi password and Google-calendar credentials **out of the
  template** into a secret store / settings (env or a `Setting`/`SecretConfig` model), and reconsider the
  IP gate — replace `insideGAHK()` reflection-of-secrets with either an authenticated role or a server-side
  config lookup, so secrets are never literals in source. **PRESERVE:** the page content/links, the
  on-campus-only visibility behavior (if still desired), and the URLs `/nyintern/` and `/nyintern/dashboard/`.
- **URL pattern:** route both `/nyintern/` and `/nyintern/dashboard/` to the dashboard view (301/alias as
  in CI).
- Decide explicitly whether the dashboard should now increment the visit counter (it currently does not).

## Open questions
- Where should the Wi-Fi password and shared Google-calendar credentials live going forward? (Secrets
  manager / env / DB-backed editable setting?) Who owns rotating them, given they are currently
  source-committed?
- Is the **campus-IP gating** still the intended access model for these secrets, or should it become a
  proper authenticated/role check? The current allow-list (6 IPv4 addresses) is likely stale.
- Is the **absence of the visit counter on the dashboard** intentional, or an oversight that should be
  reproduced then fixed?
- The shared Google-calendar account credentials suggest a single shared Google login — is that account
  still in use, and should the embed/credentials be replaced by a proper integration?
- Confirm whether the redundant manual `session_start()` matters for session behavior or is dead code
  inherited across intern controllers.

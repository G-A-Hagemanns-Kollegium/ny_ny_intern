"""Monthly AK assessment (F-009): charge every current resident the configured krydser for the active
month. The amount and whether a month is charged is set by AK officers per calendar month via the AK
schedule (`AkMonthlyCharge`, same amount every year); this command just applies the active period
through the same idempotent service. If that calendar month has no schedule row yet, a default (active,
2 krydser) one is created — the historical −2 behaviour. Idempotent; schedule monthly if desired."""

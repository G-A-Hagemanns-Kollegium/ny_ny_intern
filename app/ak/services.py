"""AK monthly-charge reconciliation (F-009).

The AK calendar (per-month `AkMonthlyCharge` config) is the source of truth for the monthly kryds
deduction. `apply_monthly_charge` makes the append-only `AkEntry` ledger match it for one period:
each resident on that month's alumneliste gets exactly one MONTHLY entry of `-krydser`; residents not
on the list are never charged (and any stale charge is removed). Idempotent — safe to re-run.

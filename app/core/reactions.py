"""One-emoji-per-person reactions, shared by Den Hurtige and opslagstavlen.

The invariant both features rely on is "one person, one emoji per item": picking a different emoji
*moves* your reaction, picking the one you already used *clears* it. It is enforced in the database
by a UniqueConstraint on (item, author) in each app, which is what makes the toggle safe under a
double tap — and it is encoded once here so the two cannot drift into different semantics.

Deliberately generic over the owning field rather than over the model: each app keeps its own
concrete reaction table with a real foreign key. A single generic-FK table was considered and
rejected — a GenericForeignKey has no database-level FK, so a bulk delete (opslagstavlen's
retention purge) would leave orphaned reaction rows behind unless every model also carried a
GenericRelation. A purge that silently leaks rows for the lifetime of the board is exactly the
failure mode that feature must not have.

    """What this module needs of a reaction row: which emoji, and whose it is.

    Declared as read-only properties rather than plain attributes on purpose: a Protocol attribute is
    *invariant*, so `emoji: str` would refuse a Django model whose field descriptor is not exactly
    `str`. This function only ever reads them, so read-only is both truer and more permissive.

    `author` (the object) is needed as well as `author_id` because the reader panel names people.
    That makes the loaded author a requirement of every caller, which is deliberate: it is enforced
    by the Prefetch(..., select_related("author")) both apps pass, and folding the join into the
    reactions query rather than nesting a second prefetch keeps the query count flat whether an item
    has reactions or none — which is exactly what the "no extra query per reaction" tests assert.

    Takes an iterable of reaction rows rather than the item itself, so callers pass a *prefetched*
    collection and this stays a pure function (unit-testable without a database). That is not just
    tidiness: a list page renders every item, so resolving counts with a per-item aggregate would be
    an N+1 — on Den Hurtige's 20-second poll it was six queries every twenty seconds per open tab.

    `people` is who used that emoji, in the order they reacted, for the reader panel that answers
    "who liked this?". Built here rather than in a second function so the panel can never disagree
    with the pills about ordering or grouping — they are the same list, rendered twice.

    Ties break on first use, which keeps the row from reshuffling under a thumb.

"""Regnskab (accounting) settlement view (F-010 role family).

The accounting embedsgruppe settles a moved-out resident's housing deposit. For that they need to see
what the resident still owes the dorm: AK labour (krydser; negative = behind) and their ølkælder
balance (kr; negative = owes the bar). AK has no monetary value defined in the system, so it is shown
as raw krydser and accounting converts it by their own rules.

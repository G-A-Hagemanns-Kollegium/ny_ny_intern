"""Rooms views: vaerelsestjek (F-005 condition inspection). soegvaerelse (F-004) added separately.

F-005 fixes: ORM (no SQLi), CSRF, and the unflag-old + create-new write is atomic. (Per-criterion image
*upload* is a later refinement — see model note; legacy image path references are shown read-only.)

Superseded reports are kept (`is_current=False`) and surfaced by the "vis tidligere rapport" dropdown
on `besvar`; submitting always writes a NEW current report, so viewing an old one never mutates it.
The legacy equivalents of these screens are worth knowing about: its per-criterion lock rendered every
field `disabled` until JS re-enabled them (so nothing posted without JS — F-005 calls this a bug, and
the port inverts it), and its AK overview filled cells positionally from a delimited blob, putting
every score under the wrong heading.

Access: inspecting a room is open to **every logged-in resident**, not just the inspektion role — room
checks are done by whoever is around, and gating them behind an embedsgruppe just meant the work
stalled. Each RoomCondition records who wrote it (`resident`, `recorded_by_name`, `recorded_at`) and
superseded ones are kept with `is_current=False`, so the history stays attributable. `akoverview`
remains AK-only: it is the AK group's own screen, not part of the inspection flow.

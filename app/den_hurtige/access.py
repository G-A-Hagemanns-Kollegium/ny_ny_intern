"""Who may reach Den Hurtige — the single switch for the whole feature.

The staged rollout is over. The feature was trialled with the administrator group and Inspektionen
first, so that a bad notification experience (or a Brave user who cannot subscribe) was found by
three people rather than a hundred; ACCESS_ROLES is now None and every resident is in.

    TO RE-GATE IT: set ACCESS_ROLES to a tuple of roles.

That one edit narrows the views, the sidebar entry and the live-feed poll together. It has never
governed individual channels, in either direction: den_hurtige.channels carries its own per-channel
`roles` which stacks on top of this one, so opening the rollout did NOT open a channel restricted to
a role. This gate is about the feature; that one is about one feed within it.

The module stays rather than being deleted with the trial, as the original plan had it, because two
things here are still load-bearing: MODERATOR_ROLES, and `roles_allowed` — the function
den_hurtige.channels.allowed mirrors.

The gate MECHANISM moved to core.rollout when begivenheder became the third feature to want it; see
that module's docstring for why the copy-it-again argument expired at three. What is left below is
this feature's own policy plus the thin re-exports that keep every caller unchanged.

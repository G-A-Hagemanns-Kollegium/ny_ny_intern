"""Nudge the people who have not answered, shortly before a deadline closes.

Scheduled daily (DEPLOY.md §4b). Idempotent, as everything on that schedule must be: the claim is a
compare-and-swap on Event.reminder_sent_at, so a double run or two overlapping runs send one
reminder between them.

THE CLAIM HAPPENS BEFORE THE SEND, and the order is deliberate. A crash between the two loses one
reminder; the other order would push the whole house twice. Losing one is recoverable — somebody
opens the page — and double-notifying sixty people is not.

Delivery is INLINE (`background=False`). core.push hands the fan-out to a daemon thread by default,
which is right in a request and fatal here: handle() returns, the interpreter shuts down, and Python
kills the thread mid-send. That would deliver to however many devices it happened to reach, a
different number every night, with no error anywhere. See core.push.send.
